      <p style="margin-left: 70px; margin-right:70px; text-align: center;"><b>Imagination is innate within all of us.  
        Indulge it, express it, fuel it! 
        For what wants to living a world without creativity?</b></p>
        <p>  Helping people has always been one of my biggest passions.
          First in Girl Scouts and leading into becoming a teacher.  
          I never would have guessed by life would lead me into coding.
          In fact I rememeber adamantly HATING everything to do with the computer throughout my grade school and even college years.
          It wasn't until getting a teaching job at a cyber charter school in Pennsylvania, that I really started to see how important technology is to my passion.
          After developing 5 online curriculums in Moodle and being an online science teacher for 9 years I realized my talents could be used to help the entire school.
          At that time I transitioned into Instructional Systems Design, at the same online charter school where I had been teaching.
        </p>
        <p>  Life has again thrown some unpredicted curve balls straight at my head.
          Causing me to shift focus once again.
          I have enrolled in UPenn's Full Stack Web Development BootCamp to help me with the next phase.

      <h1>Birth Place</h1>
      <p style="margin-left: 25px;">Orginally from Fairless Hills, PA.</p>
      <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
      <p style="margin-left: 25px;">Really anything outdoors, that doesn't involve winter so much, is something I'm willing to try.
        I love hiking, camping, canoeing and kayaking, kite flying, and even just sitting out to enjoy nature.
      </p>
      <h1>Dream job</h1>
      <p style="margin-left: 25px;">My dream job would involve helping an orgainzation create online content to help extend the learning of others.</p>
      <h1>Location</h1>
      <p style="margin-left: 25px;">Now I live in Downingtown, PA</p>
      <h1>Reasoning for Taking BootCamp</h1>
      <p style="margin-left: 25px;">Mainly I want to officially learn the skills I started to learn as an Instructional Systems Designer in order to branch out. 
        Taking the full stack BootCamp is a stepping stone to understanding the various languages and behind the scenes aspects of development.
        My goal is to attain a job within in industry where I can grow into an Instructional Systems Designer for a company.
